Hi Humans!

Muzo Here! I also started coding and I loved it. After that, I have to work hard to improve myself.

Introduction to Computer Science

In this introduction to computer programming course, l learned and practice key computer science concepts by building my own versions of popular web applications. I learned Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and I explored computer science basics, as I builded my own search engine and social network. l learned the programming language Python, and I explored foundational concepts in computer science. Most importantly, l started thinking like a software engineer by solving interesting problems (how to build a web crawler or a social network) using computer programming. l prepared for intermediate-level computer science classes when I have mastered the concepts covered in this course.
